            <li>Background</li><p><b>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that originated in the 16th century in South East England. </b>
                <i>It quickly became popular and was named the national sport of England in the 18th century.</i> The game has since 
                spread to other parts of the world, leading to the establishment of international cricket and numerous cricket
                teams. Cricket is played between two teams of eleven players each, and it requires teamwork, skill, and strategy. 
                The sport is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and is known for its strategic gameplay and passionate fans.
                Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions, serving as a source of entertainment, inspiration, and national pride.</p>
            <li>Foundation</li><p>Cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over one hundred 
                countries and territories in membership, though only twelve currently play Test cricket.The game's rules 
                are defined in the "Laws of cricket". The game has various formats, ranging from T-10(Ten-10) played in around
                 90 minutes to Test matches, which can last up to five days.</p>
            <li>Expansions and termination</li><p>In cricket,<b>"expansion" generally refers to increasing the number of teams participating in a league or tournament</b>, like the IPL. 
                "Termination" in cricket refers to ending a team's innings, either by dismissing all batters, the batting team's captain declaring 
                the innings closed, or reaching the set number of overs. It can also refer to the termination of a team's participation in a league. </p>

        <ol type="i"><br>
            <li>Tournament format</li><p>Double innings matches usually have at least six hours of playing time each day, 
                with formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and additional brief informal breaks for drinks. 
                There is also a short interval between innings. Limited overs matches often last at least six hours, 
                with similar intervals and breaks, whilst the more streamlined Twenty20 matches are generally completed in under 
                four hours. T10 cricket is a newer version of the game, based on the principles of other limited overs formats, 
                but with only 10 overs per innings, and the total playing time limited to 90 minutes.</p>  
                <li>Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries</li><p>In cricket, player acquisition, squad composition, and salaries are key aspects of team management, particularly in leagues like the IPL. 
                    Teams acquire players through auctions, trades, and by signing replacements. Squads are typically composed of batsmen, bowlers, wicket-keepers, and all-rounders, with a total of 11 players in a standard team. 
                    Player salaries are determined by contracts, with different grades and tiers based on performance and contributions. </p>
                    <li>Match rules</li><p>The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the fielding team tries to dismiss the batsmen and restrict their scoring. The team with the most runs at the end of the match wins. </p>
                    <li>Prize money</li><p>Over the years, the IPL prize money has grown exponentially; DDCA wins 'Best Pitch and Ground' award. Newly crowned IPL champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru have received ₹20 crore for winning the 18th edition of the league while runners-up Punjab Kings got richer by ₹12.5 crore</p>

            <li>Current teams</li><p>This is a list of current first-class cricket teams, organised first by country and then alphabetically. A first class match is one of three or more days' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each which is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams. Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each.</p>
            <li>Defunct teams</li><p>This category has been created to hold articles about cricket clubs that played first-class or important matches in the past, but which do not hold first-class or List A status in the 21st century. Some of the clubs are extant while others have folded, though some of the latter have been refounded as minor clubs. </p>
            <li>Timeline</li><p>In cricket, timing refers to the precise moment a batsman makes contact with the ball using the bat, aiming to maximize the power and accuracy of the shot. It's about hitting the ball at the right time, not necessarily the hardest, to achieve optimal results. </p>
